# Media Design Website
This project about "media design" is part of my studies at the BHT Berlin.
It features various exercises about lighting, positioning and color contrasts. It also features an album cover design and a logo animation.
Each exercise has a collapsable description.

The project language is german.
The website is built with HTML and CSS.
